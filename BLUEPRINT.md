# Project Blueprint: Drone Command & Control System (DCCS) — Microservices Edition

---

## 1. Project Overview

**DCCS** is a real-time, secure, and scalable backend platform for ingesting, processing, and visualizing telemetry from autonomous drones. The system is built as a set of independent microservices, each responsible for a specific domain, communicating via APIs and message queues.

---

## 2. Key Microservices

- **Telemetry Service:** Ingests and processes real-time drone telemetry (Django + Channels + REST/GraphQL).
- **Commands Service:** Issues and tracks drone commands and missions (Django + REST/GraphQL).
- **Authentication Service:** Handles JWT authentication, user management, and role-based access (Django + djangorestframework-simplejwt).
- **Dashboard Service:** Serves the operator dashboard and analytics (Django or SPA frontend).
- **(Optional) Analytics Service:** Aggregates and analyzes historical data (Django or Python microservice).

Each service is a standalone Django project, with its own database, API, and deployment pipeline.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Microservice Skeletons
- Scaffold separate Django projects for each service.
- Set up independent databases and Dockerfiles.
- Define service APIs and inter-service communication.

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement models and APIs in each service.
- Add Django Channels for real-time telemetry in Telemetry Service.
- Integrate Celery and Redis for async tasks where needed.

### Phase 3: Security & Testing
- JWT authentication via Authentication Service.
- Role-based permissions in each service.
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests per service.

### Phase 4: Deployment & DevOps
- Dockerize each service.
- Compose with `docker-compose` for local dev; Kubernetes for production.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for each service.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Demo
- Write setup and usage docs for each service.
- Document all APIs and message contracts.
- Record a demo of the full microservices system.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, Django Channels, Graphene-Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (per service)
- **Cache/Broker:** Redis (per service or shared)
- **Task Queue:** Celery (per service or shared)
- **API:** REST, GraphQL
- **Auth:** JWT (centralized via Authentication Service)
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Nginx, Gunicorn, GitHub Actions, AWS
- **Frontend:** SPA (React/Vue) or Django templates (served by Dashboard Service)

---

## 6. How This Project Matches Baykar’s Requirements

- **Service Architecture:** True microservices, each with its own codebase, DB, and deployment.
- **API Design:** REST & GraphQL APIs for inter-service and external communication.
- **Data Modeling:** Normalized PostgreSQL schemas per service.
- **Message Queues & Caching:** Celery + Redis for async tasks and caching.
- **Clean Code & Testing:** Best practices, comprehensive tests, and CI/CD per service.
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, Gunicorn.
- **Security:** JWT, role-based access, centralized authentication.
- **DevOps:** Git, GitHub Actions, AWS deployment.
- **Collaboration:** Clear service boundaries, API contracts, and scalable design.
